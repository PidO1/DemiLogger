      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>This is the North-West Univarsity's lecturer assistant web-page. The amount of work to be done by lecturers in
        their area is sometimes near impossible for them to do everything they need to do, not to mention at the
        standards that are expected. In order to make these workloads easier, the North-West Univarsity has a lecturer
        assistant program that allow students to take part in this colossal undertaking. The lecturer assistant program
        is a program designed to allow students to help out in various tasks given by lecturers in hopes of not only
        lightening the work load of those lectures, but also give students the change to acquire much needed skills for
        later use in life. At the end students also get paid fair amounts of money to make all the hard work and effort
        of semesters worthwhile.</p>
